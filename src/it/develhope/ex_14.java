    /**
     * 3: Write answers below for the following 4 situations, should we use a while, do while, fori or for each loop?
     *    Which would work best? Why?
     *
     * Q Example: Print out the numbers 1 to 10
     * A Example: fori
     *
     * Q1: A user inputs their actions into an ATM, they can withdraw, deposit, check balance or exit. What loop should we use?
     * A1:fori because we must be able to manipulate data while iterating(e.g. if we withdraw the balance must be changed) and not read only
     *
     * Q2: We have a list of 1000 users to send emails to
     * A2:foreach because we send an email for each user on the list
     *
     * Q3: We want to print out the first 80 customer names from our bank database
     * A3:a do while because we want to print names while names on list is < 80
     *
     * Q4: We want to read a file 100 lines at a time, without loading the full file into our program
     * A4:do while because we want to read 100 lines at the time while the file is finished.
